📦 Features by Phase
✅ Phase 3 – Contract Upload & OCR

Upload PDF / image contracts

Extract raw legal text safely

✅ Phase 4 – SLA Extraction

Extracted clauses include:

APR

Lease term

Monthly payment

Mileage limits

Penalties & early termination clauses

Designed with safe fallbacks to handle incomplete or noisy contracts.

✅ Phase 5 – Vehicle Intelligence

VIN detection from contract text

Vehicle make / model / year

Metadata via external vehicle APIs

🔁 Phase 6 – Contract Insights (Redesigned)

⚠️ Important Design Decision (Mentor-Driven)

Initially, a numeric fairness score was explored.
However, because vehicle price data is not reliably available, a numeric score could be misleading.

🔄 Redesign Outcome
The system now provides clear, explainable contract insights instead of arbitrary scoring.

✔ Contract Pros

Reasonable interest rate (if applicable)

Standard mileage allowance

No aggressive penalties detected

⚠ Contract Cons

Low mileage limits

Early termination charges

Ambiguous or strict penalty clauses

This approach is:

More transparent

Easier to justify in interviews

Aligned with real-world data constraints

✅ Phase 7 – AI Negotiation Assistant

Context-aware chatbot

Uses:

Contract text

Extracted SLA data

Vehicle intelligence

Example questions:

“Is this contract risky?”

“What can I negotiate?”

“Explain the mileage clause”

✅ Phase 7A–7C – Reporting & UI

Unified contract insight report (JSON)

Downloadable PDF contract review

Fully integrated dashboard UI
